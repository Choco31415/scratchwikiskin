ScratchJR-Wiki-Skin
=================

I forked this so I can specialize it for the ScratchJR Wiki a new wiki.

If you'd like to help fix bugs in the skin for the Scratch Wiki, please fork, make and test changes, and then submit a pull request. Our design goals are to keep the wiki skin as simple and as easy to use as possible. So we're unlikely to accept pull requests for fancy features, or code that's difficult to maintain.
